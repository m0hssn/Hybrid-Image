This repository contains code and examples for creating hybrid images using the hybrid image technique.

# What is a hybrid image?
A hybrid image is an image that combines two different images in such a way that the resulting image appears to change as the viewing distance changes. This is achieved by combining the low spatial frequencies of one image with the high spatial frequencies of another image. The result is an image that appears to be one thing when viewed up close, but changes into something else when viewed from further away.
